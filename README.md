IDEA DESCRIPTION:
This project integrates NMAP network scanning with a Discord bot to create an automated Message Control Protocol (MCP) for security monitoring.The bot scans IP addresses for vulnerabilities and sends real-time alerts to Discord channels, enabling faster response and improved network security management without manual intervention.

TECH STACKS/TOOLS USED:
1.Programming Language: Python
2.Discord Bot Framework: discord.py
3.Network Scanning: Nmap (python-nmap)
4.Task Automation (Low-Code): Zapier / Pipedream
5.Data Storage: Google Sheets / Airtable
6.Real-Time Alerts: Discord Webhooks
7.Hosting (Optional): Replit / Heroku / AWS Lambd

USE CASE:
1.Security & Network Monitoring
             Helps Discord server admins & cybersecurity teams monitor open ports & 
             vulnerability
2.Automated Threat Detection
             Detects unauthorized open ports & alerts security channels in real time.
3.IT & DevOps Support
             Assists IT teams in scanning internal networks for misconfigurations.
4.Logging & Compliance
             Stores scan results in Google Sheets/Airtable for auditing & compliance
             checks.
5.Easy No-Code Integration
             Allows non-technical users to trigger security scans using simple scan     
             commands.


HOW IS YOUR IDEA DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING IDEA?
1.Real-time Discord Alerts:
Unlike traditional Nmap reporting (which is manual or CLI-based), this solution pushes alerts instantly to Discord, making it easier for teams to respond quickly.

2.Automated & Customizable:
Can be set to run scans at scheduled intervals or manually triggered via Discord commands.
Filters only critical vulnerabilities, reducing noise in reports.

3.Multi-Purpose for Different Users:
Useful for security teams, IT admins, and pentestersâ€”not just Nmap experts.

HOW WILL IT BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM?
1.Accelerated Threat Response: 
            Security teams receive immediate alerts, eliminating delays associated with 
            manual scans.
2.Enhanced Network Protection: 
            Potential vulnerabilities, such as misconfigurations and risky open ports, 
            are proactively identified. 
3.Simplified Report Access: 
            Scan results are readily available via Discord, removing the need to sift 
            through raw data.
4.Flexible Security Automation: 
             The system allows for customization, enabling features like automated 
             logging, malicious IP blocking, and policy enforcement.
